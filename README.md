# Ontology-of-Relationships

This repository provides a set of ontologies containing generic relationships ('relations' for short).
Example relationships include: has, has a, is a, part of, has part, causes, is caused by, ...

Relationship ontologies include:

- The Generic Relatonship Ontology / The Relationship Ontology

History/Rationale: In the course of developing the Orbital Space Ontologies (https://purl.org/space-ontology), relations I need(ed) to assert were often generic and domain-neutral, i.e., they were not specific to the given domain ontology.
Therefore, for widerapplicability, and given my education in ontology, it was important to modularize those broader relations in an ontology of their own that could then be imported into any ontology.
